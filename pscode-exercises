  // Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers



(ask for number 1
ask for number 2
add number one and number two
print the answer on the screen)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(ask for a number equal to or greater than 3
divide that number by the number 2
if the answer is a whole number, print the word even on the screen
if the answer is not a whole number, print the word odd on the screen)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(ask for number 1
ask for number 2
ask for number 3
ask for number 4
ask for number 5
add number 1 and number 2 and number 3 and number 4 and number 5
divide that answer by 5
print the answer on the screen with "the average of your numbers is X"
if number 1 is greater than number 2, number 3, number 4, or number 5 then "your first number is the largest of the five you entered"
if number 2 is greater than number 1, number 3, number 4, or number 5 then "your second number is the largest of the five you entered"
if number 3 is greater than number 1, number 2, number 4, or number 5 then "your third number is the largest of the five you entered"
if number 4 is greater than number 1, number 2, number 3, or number 5 then "your fourth number is the largest of the five you entered"
if number 5 is greater than number 1, number 2, number 3, or number 4 then "your fifth number is the largest of the five you entered"
if number 1 is smaller than number 2, number 3, number 4, or number 5 then "your first number is the smallest of the five you entered"
if number 2 is smaller than number 1, number 3, number 4, or number 5 then "your second number is the smallest of the the five you entered"
if number 3 is smaller than number 1, number 2, number 4, or number 5 then "your third number is the smallest of the five you entered"
if number 4 is smaller than number 1, number 2, number 3, or number 5 then "your fourth number is the smallest of the five you entered"
if number 5 is smaller than number 1, number 2, number 3, or number 4 then "your fifth number is the smallest of the five you entered" )
